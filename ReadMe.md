# Repository ReadMe

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate the use of generative AI in various applications. The scripts showcase the use of LangChain, OpenAI, and other AI libraries to build intelligent agents and perform complex tasks.

## Installation
To install the required packages, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required packages and their dependencies.

## Usage
Each script in this repository can be run independently. To use a script, simply copy the code from the script file and paste it into a new Python file. Then, run the script using the `python` command.

Some scripts require input data, such as PDFs, PowerPoints or SQL databases. I recommend to upload your own files for your specific application.

## ChatGPT API & Ollama
Most of the scripts in this repository use either OpenAI models through their API or are dependent on Ollama.
To use the OpenAI models, generate your own API key on the OpenAI website and connect billing information.
Ollama is an open source technology to run LLM's locally. It provides access to a variety of open source models developed by Meta and Microsoft, 
most notably the LLaMa series. Download it from here: [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
